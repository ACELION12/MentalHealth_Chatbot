1. It Will Pass: A panic attack is a surge of adrenaline. It feels dangerous, but it is not fatal. It typically peaks within 10 minutes and then subsides. You are safe.

2. Box Breathing: Inhale for 4 seconds, hold for 4 seconds, exhale for 4 seconds, hold for 4 seconds. Repeat. This physically forces your nervous system to calm down.

Quick grounding & breathing exercises (short, safe scripts)

1) 4-4-8 Breathing (simple)
- Inhale quietly through your nose for 4 seconds.
- Hold for 4 seconds.
- Exhale slowly through your mouth for 8 seconds.
Repeat 3–5 times.

2) 5-4-3-2-1 Grounding (senses)
- Name 5 things you can see around you.
- Name 4 things you can physically feel.
- Name 3 things you can hear.
- Name 2 things you can smell (or want to smell).
- Name 1 thing you can taste or a favorite taste memory.
Use slowly and breathe between steps.

3) Muscle release (quick)
- Tighten your shoulders and hold 3 seconds, then release.
- Tighten fists, hold 3 seconds, then release.
- Stand and stretch arms overhead if safe to do so.

These are coping tools for distress — not substitutes for clinical care.

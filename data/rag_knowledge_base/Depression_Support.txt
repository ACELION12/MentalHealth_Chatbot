1. Behavioral Activation: Depression often leads to avoidance of activities. The antidote is "Behavioral Activation"—doing small tasks even when you don't feel like it. Start with tiny goals, like making your bed or brushing your teeth. Action often precedes motivation.

2. The "3 Good Things" Exercise: Every evening, write down three small things that went well or that you are grateful for. This retrains the brain to scan for positives rather than negatives.

3. Challenge Negative Thoughts: Depression lies to you. It says "I am a failure." Challenge this by asking: "What is the evidence for this? What is the evidence against this? What would I tell a friend in this situation?"

4. Physical Movement: A 10-minute walk outside can boost serotonin levels. You don't need a full workout; just moving your body changes your emotional state.

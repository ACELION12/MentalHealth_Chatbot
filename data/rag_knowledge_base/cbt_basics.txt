Cognitive Behavioral Therapy, or CBT, is a type of talk therapy that helps people identify and change destructive or disturbing thought patterns that have a negative influence on behavior and emotions. The core idea of CBT is that our thoughts, feelings, and behaviors are interconnected, and that changing negative thoughts can lead to changes in feelings and actions. It is a highly effective treatment for conditions like depression, anxiety disorders, and phobias.

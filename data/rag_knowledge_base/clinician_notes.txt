Clinician guidance for reviewing RAG flagged content (admin only)
- If RAG flags content as 'requires clinician review', the clinician should:
  1) Check whether any retrieved document contains procedural instructions for self-harm — remove if present.
  2) Provide a short verified resource or local hotline contacts rather than procedural steps.
  3) If user indicates imminent risk, follow local protocols (emergency contact, duty of care).
- When providing resources, include concise citation: source title and date.
- Keep responses short (1–3 brief paragraphs) and always encourage contacting local emergency services if danger is immediate.

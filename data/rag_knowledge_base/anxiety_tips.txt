There are several simple techniques to help manage moments of anxiety. One is the 4-7-8 breathing technique: breathe in for 4 seconds, hold your breath for 7 seconds, and exhale slowly for 8 seconds. Another is the 5-4-3-2-1 grounding technique: identify 5 things you can see, 4 things you can touch, 3 things you can hear, 2 things you can smell, and 1 thing you can taste. These techniques help bring your focus back to the present moment and away from anxious thoughts.

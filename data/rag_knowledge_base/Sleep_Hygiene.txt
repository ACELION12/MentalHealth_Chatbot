1. The "Worry Time" Technique: If racing thoughts keep you awake, schedule "Worry Time" earlier in the day (e.g., 5:00 PM for 20 minutes). Write down your worries then. If they pop up at night, tell yourself, "I have already dealt with this," or "I will deal with this tomorrow."

2. The 20-Minute Rule: If you cannot sleep after 20 minutes, get out of bed. Go to another room and do something boring (read a manual, fold laundry) in dim light until you are sleepy. Do not look at screens. This prevents your brain from associating the bed with wakefulness.

3. Screen Curfew: Blue light from phones mimics daylight and stops melatonin production. Stop using screens 60 minutes before bed.

4. Caffeine Cutoff: Caffeine has a half-life of 5-6 hours. Avoid coffee, tea, or soda after 2:00 PM to ensure it leaves your system before sleep.
